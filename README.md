# AIOE and Related Datasets

This repository contains the data files produced by the project "Occupational, Industry, and Geographic Exposure to Artificial Intelligence: A Novel Dataset and Its Potential Uses" by Felten, Raj, and Seamans. 

The following briefly describes the datasets contained in the excel file "AIOE_DataAppendix.xlsx". For more information regarding the construction of the datasets, please see the draft, currently located here: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smj.3286

If you use any of the AIOE data, please include the following citation:

Below is a list of data posted on this page:
 
Data Appendix A: AIOE Scores by Occupation. Contains the constructed AIOE scores by occupation indexed by six-digit SOC code.

Data Appendix B: AIIE Scores by Industry. Contains the constructed AIIE scores by industry indexed by four-digit NAICS code.

Data Appendix C: AIGE Scores by Geography. Contains the constructed AIGE scores by county indexed by US FIPS code.

Data Appendix D: AI Application-Occupational Ability Matrix. Contains the application-ability relatedness matrix constructed using an mTurk survey. 

Data Appendix E: Standardized Ability-Level AI Exposure. Contains the standardized ability-level exposure to AI constructed by aggregating exposure across applications within ability.

The files within the input folder contain the code and underlying files that construct the data in the Data Appendix. 

In addition, we have added data and code to produce AIOE scores for the generative AI applications of image generation and language modeling.
